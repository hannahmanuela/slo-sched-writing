\noindent Brief Statement of the Problem:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}

\noindent Many popular containerization frameworks, such as Kubernetes and
AFaas, rely on Linux's cgroups to isolate the performance of different
containers running on the same machine. This thesis shows that Linux's ability
to actually implement that isolation is lacking, mostly due to the way that load
is balanced across cores. We implement a small change to Linux, and show that it
dramatically improves Linux's ability to isolate latency critical workloads from
best effort ones.

\noindent Supervision Agreement:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}
\noindent The program outlined in this proposal is adequate for a Master's thesis. The
supplies and facilities required are available, and I am willing to supervise
the research and evaluate the thesis report.
