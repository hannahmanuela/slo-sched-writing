We identify a serious limitation of \cgroups{} weights: they are unable to honor
the reservations of LC applications in the presence BE workloads. We show that
this is because Linux uses per-core runqueues.

We propose an API that separates BE from LC by introducing \beclass{}.
\beclass{} ensures that no BE is ever running when an LC is queued, and requires
fewer cross-core interactions than a weight-based approach to do so.

We implement this strict priority in Linux.
