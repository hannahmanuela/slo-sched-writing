This work shows that \cgroups{} weights, used by systems like Kubernetes to
separate LC from BE, are unable to effectively honor the reservations of LC
applications in the presence BE workloads, and that this is because Linux uses
per-core runqueues. 

Instead, we propose an API that separates BE from LC by introducing \beclass{},
which requires fewer cross-core interactions than a weight-based approach, and
ensures that no BE is ever running when an LC is queued.

We implement this strict priority in Linux, and show that \beclass{} allows
\cgroups{} itself, as well as higher level applications like Kubernetes, to
ensure LC processes' access to their reserved cores while running BE workloads
opportunistically.
