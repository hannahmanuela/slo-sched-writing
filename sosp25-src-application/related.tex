Some work focuses on isolating real-time applications in
Linux~\cite{rt-in-linux, state-rt-linux}. Wasted Cores~\cite{wasted-cores}
improves the idle behavior of Linux, whereas we change the way developers
express what is LC and what is BE.

Linux's \schedidle{} policy addresses the observed weight inversion, but is
still inadequate: running the microbenchmark using \schedidle{} leads to an
increase in the mean latency from 6ms to 8ms.

Other schedulers run primarily in userspace in order to work around the kernel
scheduler~\cite{perfiso,caladan,skyloft}. This paper identifies the core problem
in the kernel scheduler and addresses it.
