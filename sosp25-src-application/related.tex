Wasted Cores~\cite{wasted-cores} improves the idle behavior of Linux, whereas we
change the API to the scheduler.

Linux's \schedidle{} policy addresses the observed weight inversion, but is
inadequate: running the microbenchmark using \schedidle{} leads to a mean
latency increase from 6ms to 8ms.

Other schedulers run primarily in userspace in order to work around the kernel
scheduler~\cite{perfiso,caladan,skyloft}. This paper avoids doing so by
identifying the core problem and addressing it.
