\section{Related work}

Some existing work focuses on isolating real-time applications in
Linux~\cite{rt-in-linux, state-rt-linux}, while Wasted Cores~\cite{wasted-cores}
focuses on the idle behavior of the Linux scheduler.

Other systems work around the kernel scheduler, by running primarily in
userspace~\cite{perfiso,caladan,skyloft}.

Linux's own \schedidle{} policy attempts to address this issue, but does not
fully solve it (running the microbenchmark using \schedidle{} still leads to an
increase in the mean latency from 6ms to 8).
