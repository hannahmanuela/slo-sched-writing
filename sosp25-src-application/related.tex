Some work focuses on isolating real-time applications in
Linux~\cite{rt-in-linux, state-rt-linux}. Wasted Cores~\cite{wasted-cores}
addresses the idle behavior of Linux. 

Linux's \schedidle{} policy addresses the observed weight inversion, but is
still inadequate: running the microbenchmark using \schedidle{} leads to an
increase in the mean latency from 6ms to 8ms.

Other systems work around the kernel scheduler, by running primarily in
userspace~\cite{perfiso,caladan,skyloft}.
