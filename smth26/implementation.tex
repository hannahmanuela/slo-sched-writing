\section{Implementation}\label{s:implementation}


In order to affect the changes required, we modify Linux and put in the pieces
to make \schedidle{} effectively its own scheduling class. We chose to do this
rather than create an entirely new scheduling class in the code, which would be
intellectually cleaner and closer to the conceptual reality, but would require
more code changes and leave \schedidle{} in it's current half-formed
state.\hmng{bad structure}

We write a Linux patch that turns \schedidle{} into effectively a separate
scheduling class. The patch intervenes in two places in the current scheduling
process of the Normal scheduler: 1: it ensures that no \schedidle{} entity will
be chosen if there is a runnable \schednormal{} entity (this overrides the fair
share that even a weight 1 process would occasionally get in the unmodified
kernel), and 2: it tries to steal queued \schednormal{} entities from other
cores before running a \schedidle{} entity.
