We can see the resulting performance in figure~\ref{fig:patched-idle}, and see
that as desired the latency of the server remains stable after the background
tasks start. This does not mean that the background task never runs: the lower
graph still shows iterations of image resizing being done. The difference is
that now the background tasks will reliably get interrupted when the LC server
has a request to process.
