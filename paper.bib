abstract = {Current day database applications, with large numbers of users, require fine-grained access control mechanisms, at the level of individual tuples, not just entire relations/views, to control which parts of the data can be accessed by each user. Fine-grained access control is often enforced in the application code, which has numerous drawbacks; these can be avoided by specifying/enforcing access control at the database level. We present a novel fine-grained access control model based on authorization views that allows "authorization-transparent" querying; that is, user queries can be phrased in terms of the database relations, and are valid if they can be answered using only the information contained in these authorization views. We extend earlier work on authorization-transparent querying by introducing a new notion of validity, conditional validity. We give a powerful set of inference rules to check for query validity. We demonstrate the practicality of our techniques by describing how an existing query optimizer can be extended to perform access control checks by incorporating these inference rules.},

We propose a strawman design for Hippocratic databases, identify the technical challenges and problems in designing such databases, and suggest some approaches that may lead to solutions. Our hope is that this paper will serve to catalyze a fruitful and exciting direction for future database research.},

isbn = {9781931971966},

address = {USA},
abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of answering queries about private data that is spread across multiple different databases. For instance, a medical researcher may want to study a possible correlation between travel patterns and certain types of illnesses. The necessary information exists today - e.g., in airline reservation systems and hospital records - but it is maintained by two separate companies who are prevented by law from sharing this information with each other, or with a third party. This separation prevents the processing of such queries, even if the final answer, e.g., a correlation coefficient, would be safe to release.We present DJoin, a system that can process such distributed queries and can give strong differential privacy guarantees on the result. DJoin can support many SQL-style queries, including joins of databases maintained by different entities, as long as they can be expressed using DJoin's two novel primitives: BN-PSI-CA, a differentially private form of private set intersection cardinality, and DCR, a multi-party combination operator that can aggregate noised cardinalities without compounding the individual noise terms. Our experimental evaluation shows that DJoin can process realistic queries at practical timescales: simple queries on three databases with 15,000 rows each take between 1 and 7.5 hours.},
