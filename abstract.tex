    Serverless is in principle a good match for web applications, allowing
    developers to pay for the resources needed as load varies without having to
    reserve servers.

    This paper identifies the crowding problem, where under high total load,
    different tenants’ functions compete for resources, and thus can drive up each
    other’s delays. Because of this problem, existing serverless designs result in
    latencies that are not tolerable for user-facing functions, even in systems that
    have fast function start time.

    We argue for new a design based on price classes that can keep the latency of
    high price class functions stable even under high load, making it feasible to
    run web applications as functions.
