\section{Related Work}

There is a large body of work that focusses on removing the need for
reservations by creating elastic reservations that automatically scale up and
down with load~\cite*{kubernetes, snowflake}. These systems generally
operate on a much larger timescale (control loops on the order of manys
seconds~\cite{kubernetestime}), and still work within the best effort
- latency critical binary. 

There are systems that focus on increasing utilization via much more
fine-grained preemption behavior~\cite*{caladan, shinjuku}. These require
building a kernel-bypass scheduler. 

Other work does operate on the basis of deadlines, but take different appproach
to realizing those deadlines. Some try to formally pre-compute compute time to
make guarantees~\cite{jockey}, while others use the deadline to generate a
reservation~\cite*{rayon}. Morpheus~\cite*{morpheus} targets jobs with
invocation frequencies of around a day, and infers the deadline from historic
data, automatically generating recurring reservations.
