Serverless is in principle a good match for web applications, allowing
developers to pay for the resources needed as load varies without having to
reserve servers. Because of the \problem, however, existing serverless designs
result in latencies that are not tolerable for user-facing functions, even in
systems that have fast function start time.  We argue for a new design based on
\emph{\priceclass{}es} that can keep the latency of high \class{} functions
stable even under high load, making it feasible to run web applications as
functions.
